         - Support abbreviations ('tjh plh jt' => 'tujuh puluh juta')
         - Support very large numbers (until sentiliun and gugol)
         - Provide $Pat


0.13     2011-09-15 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         Handle number in exponent form. Use updated (fixed) Parse::Number::ID.


0.12     2011-09-15 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         Handle mixture of numbers and words (e.g. '1,5 juta 13 ribu' ->
         1513000).


0.11     2011-04-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [ETC]

         - bump version to 0.11, because old 0.01 version turned out set
           $VERSION to 0.1, so PAUSE requires new version to be larger than
           that.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - sprinkled 5.010 requirements. :p

         [ETC]

         - modernize stuffs (code formatting, add tests, variable names,
           comments, etc).
